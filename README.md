# CPP-modules
For the C++ modules you will use and learn C++98 only. The goal is for you to learn
the basic of an object oriented programming language. We know modern C++ is way
different in a lot of aspects so if you want to become a proficient C++, developer you
will need modern standard C++ later on. This will be the starting point of your C++
journey it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common Core!
